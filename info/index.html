					<h2>Hi,</h2>
					<p>
						My name is Taichi Aritomo. I'm a Japanese-American in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h2><em>About me</em></h2>
					<p>
						Since late-2018, I've been programming websites with
						<a href="http://beautiful-company.com">Beautiful Company</a>,
						the graphic design practice of <a href="http://laurelschwulst.com">Laurel Schwulst</a>,
						and volunteering at the <a href="https://www.adaptivedesign.org/">Adaptive Design Association</a>.
						For a while, I've also been teaching informally
						as a tutor, workshopper, or summer school teacher.
						These exposures got me interested in programming and improvisation,
						how the decisions we record into technology can complement our aspirations, our growth, and the surprises of reality.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h2><em>About this website</em></h2>
					<!-- <p>
						At first, I thought this website should be like a clearing in the woods.
						You might've found it by googling, but I'd never know.
						I thought I'd be able to publish with less self-consciousness that way.
					</p> -->
					<p>
						Last year, I realized the importance of being seen...
						Gardening in the spring, I got closer to my neighbors just by being outside every day.
						Working on my grad school applications, I grew a lot by trying to tell my friends about my intentions and work.
						Sharing little moments of my day on Instagram, I enjoyed getting responses from people I hadn't spoken to in a long time.
						All of these things made me curious about ways to participate in networked culture so I can grow sustainably with others.
					</p>
					<p>
						This year, I'm thinking more about this website's visibility and trying to show connections to other people and events that surround and support the things I'm doing.
						It's always a work in progress, but currently in the works: improvements in accessibility (February) and a 'friends' section for admiring out loud (March).<br/>
						<br/>
						Thanks for reading (:
					</p>
