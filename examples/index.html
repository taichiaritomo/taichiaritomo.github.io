							on the upcoming artists space website's calendar, there is a select input
							that lists every month since 1972. the trailing edge of those month-words
							oscillated with every year. it was strangely satisfying to scroll through
							so much time, see it vibrate at you like that... maybe i should make a version
							where you actively scroll to move the wave...
							i'm not sure what clicking to move the sun does for the
							whole thing. i just wanted to throw
							something interactive in there because i could, because the code was properly classed
							and stuff... the waving sun was an accident/glitch that seemed better
							not fixed.</p>

							when i was researching mapping APIs, i learned that openstreetmaps (osm)
							had landmark data for picnic tables. i'd only ever seen picnic tables
							on trail maps, but not in city maps. every couple of weeks, the osm community
							packages all of the data in the osm world into a <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">"planet mirror"</a> file
							i scraped the planet file for every picnic table location and put them into a csv file.
							there are, like, 400000 i think... this website uses the google maps api and places a
							marker for each picnic table... i thought it was nice how the canonical
							marker symbol looks like a flower petal, so when there is a cluster of them,
							i made them flowers!

							in summer of 2018, i spent six weeks at GSD's Design Discovery summer-intensive.
							it was fantastic, light-hearted, rigorous, affirming, energetic, the
							perfect space for me at the time (following the end of a lukewarm time studying
							computer science in undergrad).
							one of the generative operations that the instructors encouraged was to
							start with a grid and manipulate it somehow.
							when we were sketching for our final project, i made a series of drawings
							where an array of grid-points (the intersections of the grid-lines) were 
							moved according to repellent and attractive forces...
							sonny told me to go to hmart and buy a bag of clementines, and use the
							netting to exlore my site model with the same idea...
							this turned into a sketch model for the project as a series
							of volumes whose edges followed the grid lines...
							after Design Discovery, i spent a few days turning those drawings into
							a computer program, where the grid that was being manipulated wasn't a plaza
							but an image.
