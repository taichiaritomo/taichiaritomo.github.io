						Writing now is Taichi Aritomo, a Japanese-American in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I made this website last year, I imagined myself furnishing a clearing in the woods.
						I wouldn’t tell anyone about it.
						People might visit or stumble into it, but I wouldn’t know.
						I thought that, without self-promotion or an infrastructure of tracking or likes,
						I would be able to show things with less fear.
						By ignoring my own visibility, I hoped that I could become less self-conscious.
					</p>
					<p>
						Last year, however, I also found out how important it was for me to know my visibility.
						Outside in a garden in the spring, I became closer to my neighbors just by seeing them and being seen by them every day.
						In the winter, working on my applications for grad school,
						I learned a lot about myself by telling my friends about my intentions and work,
						which I had often shied away from doing until then.
						And over the year, I enjoyed sharing little moments of my daily life through Instagram stories and getting a response,
						sometimes from people I hadn’t spoken to in a long time.
						It seems kind of obvious written out like this—visibility is good!
						But after growing up with social media in grade school and then trying to escape it in college,
						I had to arrive at this new position not to avoid networked culture, but figure out how to participate in it in ways
						that would allow me to grow sustainably with others.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, this year, I want to cultivate a website that can help me understand mine and others’ visibility.
						To take more seriously that this website might be seen, its contents might be read, and use that opportunity wisely.
						To point to other people and events that surrounded and supported the things I was making, in order to make new connections.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's see how it goes...
