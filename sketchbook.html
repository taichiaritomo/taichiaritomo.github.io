					Bright noons on the fourteenth floor of a high-rise apartment building. Soundless noon, from before you had speakers and music. A marble rolling across the hardwood floor upstairs. The stairwell door closing, emitting a cavernous thud. The occasional hum of the elevators in the hallway, or a double-bus on center avenue. And just once a day, a loud, deep crack, how tectonic plates would sound if you had ever heard them. You know it comes from the building. This rocky white skeleton of rooms that you and your neighbors live inside is stretching its back, or adjusting its posture, a small repose in a duty with no end in sight—to stand perfectly still.

					When the day started at 12, the morning felt too long…the box of light by the window turning so so slowly, and the hum of a refrigerator. quiet was also slow. i wish for these kinds of mornings. every morning these days is too fast. the day slips by. truly it's just as long as it always was, but at the end of the day i think, ah, i couldn't get as much done today… how it felt so short… 12 arrives so soon every day.

					this could all stay in my icloud notes, like an unsaid apology
					but i want to try to reach someone
					or someone to reach me
					clearing in the woods
					making a lacy transmission tower out of sparkling ice
					hope u stumble into it one day and enjoy a moment under the filiform shade
