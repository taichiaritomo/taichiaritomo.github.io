							For a long time I was anxiously focused on making something "useful" with technology.
							In school, we'd be asked, "what can we fix with technology?"
							and then we'd be sent wandering about, holding our hammers in search of the right nail.
							I don't blame my instructors, I think they were just teaching what they learned, or
							looking for something optimistic to do with what they knew.
							We all wanted to believe that the world was full of problems waiting for us to solve them.
							This worldview has produced plenty of wonderful things, I'm sure,
							but can also be so dehumanizing and patronizing when it separates people into victims and their saviors.
							If I can help it, I want to make sure I'm not caught in these strange problem-solution dynamics!
							<br><br>
							These objects aren't solutions, they're just special effects.
							Solving problems for work, I'm often starting from a desired outcome and finding the best way there.
							The effects arise from causes, which are explicit in the code, and that's exciting like physics.
							One day I want to make funnier effects with blurrier causes, like comics,
							or more generous effects with more communal causes, like gardens.
							"Make" is a strong word, though. Maybe I should want more to just witness it. And, only if
							the need and the opportunity arise, precipitate or maintain it. In this way, being a maker
							or janitor or appreciator should give me the same fulfillment. One day I want to be free from cause and effect, like in dreams.
