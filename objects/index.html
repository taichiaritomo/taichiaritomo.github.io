							On the Artists Space website, there is a selection input
							that lists every month since its opening in 1972.
							The trailing edge of those month-words oscillate with every year.
							The wavy sun was an accidental glitch, but it turned out to be better left unfixed...

							Every few weeks, the Openstreetmaps community packages all of the OSM world data
							into a <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">"planet mirror"</a> file.
							This data includes 81,000 picnic tables.
							I've seen picnic tables on trail maps, but not on city maps.
							This website places a marker on a google map for each picnic table.
							The canonical marker symbol looks like a flower petal,
							so clusters of markers are flowers.

							At design discovery, I drew some sketches
							of a grid that was pinched and stretched.
							Sonny told me to go to Hmart, buy a bag of clementines,
							and use the plastic net that they came in
							to make a site model with the same idea...
							I spent a few days turning those operations into
							a computer program, where the grid that was being manipulated wasn't a
							public plaza but an image.

							A text editor where the letters get heavier. In chrome they start to collapse in
