        <div class="col-3-double">
          Pricing and billing for SoundCloud Go can take many different forms. Ahead of the launch of SoundCloud Go+, we wanted to create a checkout system that would accommodate variations in pricing and billing gracefully, while rendering explanations in clear, natural language.
          <br><br>
          The existing checkout page was an important reference for information that was legally required. In the previous design (hover to view), a lot of information was downplayed visually and left in legal jargon, with the assumption that most users wouldn't read it. However, from user tests we learned that people actually read the gray fine print carefully, concerned about how and when their card would be charged.

          Conditional copy modules
        </div>
        <div class="col-3-double">
          Various conditions can influence the payment terms for a subscription, from free trials to marketing promotions. <span class="highlight">I created small chunks of copy that could be combined on the front-end to form a concise explanation of the subscription terms.</span> Some of them were formulated as an answer to anticipate a user's concern, such as, "When will my card be charged?" A wildcard module was also planned, because SoundCloud was seeking to release the product in other countries, where checkout pages were regulated by regional laws that were difficult to anticipate.

          A layout that can accommodate change
        </div>
        <div class="col-3-double">
          We used a layout with columns that divide the page by content and action—a column for payment information (which the user inputs) and a column for subscription information (which the user reads). Because the columns can shrink and grow along their respective axes, the layout can gracefully accommodate additional information.
          <br><br>
          We referred to SoundCloud's style guide for consistency whenever possible, and we proposed new styles when there were no precedents or when variations were appropriate for the context. For example, we proposed a gray background for all payment forms to make form inputs easier to find in figure/ground.

          Ahead of the launch of SoundCloud Go+, we wanted to take the opportunity to make larger revisions to the subscription management page.
          <br><br>
          Meeting with product managers and community support specialists, we gathered pain points and nice-to-haves in the subscription managing experience. The previous subscriptions page had separate views for SoundCloud Go and another subscription product called SoundCloud Pro geared toward creators. Because the Go page was always shown by default, many Pro subscribers had trouble finding their settings.

          Separating and combining content based on user intentions

        <div class="col-3-double">
          We began to question the merit of having separate views for Go and Pro. After considering the various intentions that a user might have for navigating to the personal subscriptions page, we identified features to include and specified whether the feature should be separated by product or combined.

          With these rules for separating and combining, we reorganized the subscription page as one view for managing all of your SoundCloud subscriptions and payments.
          <br><br>
          We followed a style guide whenever appropriate, while carrying forward new styles from the checkout project. To complement the section labels, I designed new micro-icons that reflect user intentions—a calendar to suggest renewal and expiration, and a receipt to suggest reviewing expenses.

          We wanted to make sure that users knew how to get the most out of their subscription, or, as trial users, fully gauge the value of the product. To do this, we were working on a post-purchase welcome tour, imagined as a series of slides that would appear the first time a user opened the mobile app after subscribing to SoundCloud Go.
          <br><br>
          In user tests we learned:<br>
          1. many people swiped straight through the tour without reading anything.<br>
          2. even if they did read, they didn't always understand that SoundCloud Go+ unlocked all "preview" tracks.

          The level of "engagement" with a video advertisement affects the revenue that SoundCloud receives for that ad. For example, unmuting a video ad suggests more engagement than simply allowing it to autoplay without sound, while enlarging it to full-screen suggests maximum engagement.

          To design the transitions between these different engagement states, I iterated through an interactive prototypes built in FramerJS. The prototype also allowed us to test and define transitions in audio playback. Unmuting the ad will fade and pause the music you're listening to. When the ad ends, your music automatically fades back in.
          <br><br>
          During development, the sales team and product manager found the prototype useful for presentations to ad networks, while the engineers used it as a reference for the mobile app.
