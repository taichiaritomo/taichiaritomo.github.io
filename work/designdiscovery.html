              <p>
                For this project we were asked to create a hinge space inspired by Italo Calvino’s prose-poetry, <em>Invisible Cities</em>.<br><br>
                Calvino writes about the way that your personal memories of different cities blend together. I proposed a space in which you might find the sky, trees, birds, and flowers reflected against the shapes of the city, invading and overwriting your urban memory as you pass between the city and forest.

            The form of salt crystals is determined by a simple rule in its chemical structure, characterized by alternating Na and Cl particles.<br><br>
            I think that a system of alternating volumes could maximize variation and porosity in a dense arrangement.

              Considering the possibility of these elements being repeated across an indefinitely large field, I created a pattern consisting of five values. The volumes could hover at one of these five altitudes, producing different moments of overhead pressure. <br><br>
              The five values are evenly distributed so that duplicates are as far apart as possible—in any nine-square portion there are no repeated values.

                For this project we were asked to design a public space for conversations of various sizes, from town hall debates to exchanges between strangers.<br><br>
                On a site lying between the Boston harbor and a small arboretum, my proposal was to create a field of informal yet intimate moments for conversations in passing.

              Seminar and meeting spaces double as classrooms where resident writers could lead workshops in English speaking, reading, and writing. In this way, a space for civic engagement is actively involved in enabling more people to participate in the conversations.<br><br>

              In their workshops, the writers might work with students to produce poems, stories, and comics that may expand the representation of American experience. These works can then be displayed on curved acrylic exhibition walls that wind throughout the space.
