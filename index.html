                    A simple tool that models visual interest toward textual information.
                    It continuously processes text (left) as an image and generates its <em>saliency map</em> (right).
                    The intensity of white corresponds to the likelihood
                    that a human viewer will gaze at that point first, according to a

                    This was one of the posters made for the 2017 Conference theme, <em>footnotes</em>.
                    It was a challenge to represent a conference with perspectives as broad as TED,
                    without confining it to specific examples of tech, entertainment, or design.
                    Following the theme's premise, we wanted to illustrate the process of engaging with
                    something to appreciate it more closely, like we often did as kids.

                    the world. It lent itself well for a poster to attract new members of
                    the organizing committee, as prospective members would be joining a
                    broadly connected organization.

                    As a product design intern at SoundCloud, I worked on subscription and

                    When SoundCloud was expanding its subscription products, I worked with
                    the product team to map the new billing logic and user-flows.
                    I re-designed interfaces for payment and subscription management,
                    and occassionally shipped front-end code. Responding to user feedback,
                    the designs were aimed to make billing and cancellation more transparent.

                    <br><br>
                    I designed some of the necessary evils of SoundCloud's mobile app—new
                    ads in the stream.
                    This is the prototype I built 
                    to demonstrate how users would interact with video ads, and how 
                    they would handle audio playback handoff. For a music app,
                    it was important that the listening experience would work
                    seamlessly with the ad. You can <a href="http://share.framerjs.com/549pahj0uuzx/">demo it</a>
                    to see how music is faded and resumed
                    as the video is activated and closed.
