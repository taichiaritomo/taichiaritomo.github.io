						Hi,
					</p>
					<p>
						Writing now is Taichi Aritomo, a Japanese-American programmer in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I made this website last year, I imagined a clearing in the woods:
						People might stumble onto it, but I wouldn't really know if anyone ever did.
						Without an infrastructure of click-tracking, likes, or comments,
						I thought I'd be able to publish with less self-consciousness.
						I think it helped in some ways. I found a place to put half-formed thoughts and things,
						and a few friends responded to them personally.
					</p>
					<p>
						Last year, however, I also realized the importance of embracing visibility.
						Gardening outside in the spring, I became closer to my neighbors just by seeing them and being seen by them every day.
						In the winter, working on my applications for graduate school,
						I learned a lot about myself by telling my friends about my intentions and work, often for the first time.
						And over the year, I enjoyed sharing moments from my daily life through Instagram stories and receiving a response,
						sometimes from people I hadn’t spoken to in a long time.
						Written out like this, it seems kind of obvious—visibility good!—
						but after trying to escape social media for a while,
						I've arrived at this new position: Not to avoid networked culture, but figure out how to participate in ways
						where I can grow sustainably with others.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, this year, I hope to cultivate a website that can help me understand myself through my image.
						I hope to take more seriously that this website will be seen and use that opportunity wisely.
						I hope to point to other people and events that surrounded and supported the things I was working on,
						in order to form new connections.
					</p>
					<p>
						It will always be a work in progress, but I have started with hyperlinks to my work and my collaborators and advisors.<br/><br/>
						In the works are:<br/>
						* improvements in accessibility and web-standards,<br/>
						* a 'friends' section for admiring out loud,<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						T-shirt and shorts,<br>
