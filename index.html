                    In a research seminar at Rutgers, I built a simple tool that models
                    visual interest in textual information.
                    It continuously processes text (left) as an image and generates its <em>saliency map</em> (right).
                    The intensity of white corresponds to the likelihood
                    that a human viewer will gaze at that
                    point first, according to a
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364530_Saliency_Detection_A_Spectral_Residual_Approach">computer vision algorithm</a>
                    that models visual attention.
                    <br><br>
                    I made this tool with the hypothesis that it could help us better
                    understand the audience's experience of seeing the information that
                    we design.

                    This was one of the posters made for the 2017 Conference theme, <em>footnotes</em>.
                    It was a challenge to represent a conference with perspectives as broad as TED,
                    without confining it to specific examples of tech, entertainment, or design.
                    As the theme suggests, I wanted to illustrate the process of engaging with
                    something to see it more closely.

                    This poster was made to represent TED and TEDxRutgers' broader goal of promoting
                    "ideas worth spreading." I wanted to depict a connection between the <em>idea</em> and the <em>work</em>

                    the organizing committee, as prospective members would be joining a
