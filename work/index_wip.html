							<h3>Encoded Ink Dots</h3>
							<span class="context">for <a href="https://artistsspace.org">artistsspace.org</a>, ~April 2019</span>
							<p>
								<a href="https://laurelschwulst.com">Laurel</a> proposed that on each artist's page,
								a unique dot would appear in the tiny favicon space in your web browser.
								I wrote an algorithm to create the unique shape from each artist’s name:
								Each letter in the name is extended along a starburst.
								Then, the corners are rounded to resemble an ink blot.

								It feels liberating to give up control.
								Like sitting in the back of a bus, with a pencil that's about to fall out of your hand.
								Or, like trying to forget what a flower looks like, to draw something that reminds you of a flower.

								If you ever forgot what an analog clock did, you could recover its meaning
								by watching the hands sweep by at different speeds, cataloguing the shapes
								they make together during the day and the shapes they’ll never make.
								Clocks are meaningful because each moment of the day corresponds
								uniquely to a configuration of hands, a lossless encoding.
							</p>
							<p>
								I made a flower clock. Every second, the current time is encoded as a unique flower,
								so that each flower appears once, and then you’ll never see it again.
								The shapes are similar to the ink blots, except the input (time) also controls how
								the curves stretch and turn, producing more unpredictable shapes.

							For a long time I was anxiously focused on making something "useful" with technology.
							In school, we'd be asked, "what can we fix with technology?"
							and then we'd be sent wandering about, holding our hammers in search of the right nail.
							I don't blame my instructors, I think they were just teaching what they learned, or
							looking for something optimistic to do with what they knew.
							We all wanted to believe that the world was full of problems waiting for us to solve them.
							This worldview has produced plenty of wonderful things, I'm sure,
							but can also be so dehumanizing and patronizing when it separates people into victims and their saviors.
							If I can help it, I want to make sure I'm not caught in these strange problem-solution dynamics!
							<br><br>
							These objects aren't solutions, they're just special effects.
							Solving problems for work, I'm often starting from a desired outcome and finding the best way there.
							The effects arise from causes, which are explicit in the code, and that's exciting like physics.
							One day I want to make funnier effects with blurrier causes, like comics,
							or more generous effects with more communal causes, like gardens.
							"Make" is a strong word, though. Maybe I should want more to just witness it. And, only if
							the need and the opportunity arise, precipitate or maintain it. In this way, being a maker
							or janitor or appreciator should give me the same fulfillment. One day I want to be free from cause and effect, like in dreams.
