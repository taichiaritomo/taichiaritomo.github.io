            In 2016, SoundCloud launched SoundCloud Go, a subscription product that allows paying users to disable ads and download their favorite tracks. SoundCloud Go+ adds access to a library of licensed tracks provided by music labels, following a model similar to streaming services like Spotify.

                </div>, the billing information was downplayed visually and written in marketing or legal language. From user tests we learned that people carefully read that information, concerned about how and when their card would be charged.
              </span>
              <br><br>
              Ahead of the launch of SoundCloud Go+, we wanted to create a checkout system that would accommodate new variations in pricing and billing gracefully, while explaining them in clear, natural language.

              The subscription terms can vary by promotions and user-specific conditions. I created small chunks of copy that are combined on the front-end according to those conditions, forming a simple summary.

              We divided the page by content and action—a column for payment information (where you input) and a column for subscription information (where you read).
              <br><br>
              We also prepared to launch in other countries, where checkout pages are regulated by regional laws that are difficult to anticipate. Because each column can shrink and grow along its own axis, the layout can gracefully accommodate additional content.
              <br><br>
              We referred to SoundCloud's style guide whenever possible and proposed new styles when variations were appropriate for the context. For example, a gray background across all payment forms make inputs easier to find in figure/ground.

              Ahead of the launch of SoundCloud Go+, we wanted to take the opportunity to make larger revisions to the subscription management page.
              <br><br>
              Meeting with product managers and community support specialists, we gathered pain points and nice-to-haves in the subscription managing experience.
              <div class="image-prompt">
                <img src="../img/sc/settings_preexisting.jpg"/>
                The existing subscriptions page
              </div> had separate views for SoundCloud Go and another subscription product called SoundCloud Pro. The Go page was always shown by default, so many Pro subscribers had trouble finding the right information.

            <h4>Organizing content by user intentions</h4>
            <div>
              Although the views for Go and Pro were separate, each page had the same types of information. We matched each type to some user intention that it responded to, and thought about the form of organization that would best serve those intentions.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-3-double">

            <div>
              We then reorganized the subscription page into one view for managing all of your SoundCloud subscriptions and payments.
              <br><br>
              We treated the elements of the previous design with larger type and buttons, while carrying forward new visual ideas from the checkout project. To complement the section labels, I designed new micro-icons that reflect user intentions—a calendar to suggest renewal and expiration, and a receipt to suggest reviewing expenses.

              I worked with interactive prototypes in FramerJS to design the transitions between engagement states.
              <br><br>
              The prototype allowed me to design and test transitions and rules for video and audio playback. For example, unmuting the ad will fade and pause the music you're listening to; when the ad ends, your music automatically fades back in.
              <br><br>
              The sales team and product managers found the prototype useful for presentations, while engineers used it as a reference.

            <h5>Retrospective</h5>
            As a designer working on monetization, I struggled with the tension between designing for user experience and designing to fulfill a tech corporation's revenue demands.
            <br><br>
            When I was stuck, I found it helpful to paint the picture around a design decision, using the context to find a response that appropriately balanced the intentions of the user and the system.

            I'm thankful for my product managers—Brittney Gwynn, John Coates, and Jori Bell—and my hiring manager, Catt Small, as I was given a generous amount of guidance and trust throughout my work as an intern.
            <br><br>
            On all these projects I worked alongside an amazing product design team consisting of Catt, Shanique Shields, Adelle Charles, and Ashley Hopkins.
