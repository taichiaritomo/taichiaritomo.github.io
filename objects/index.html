							Hello... You're reading the inner-space text...<br><br>

							I'm still figuring out my voice for this, so this all might change.
							It would be cool to archive older versions to see my fickleness.
							When I'm talking in person, sometimes I have to pause for an awkwardly long amount of time to find the right word. But here, I seem to have an endless amount of time and places to put words, so I might never be finished.<br><br>

							At first wanted to talk about the images, but then felt like was using the word "I" too much. Sometimes, over Slack or email go back and take out the "I" from the sentence, just because feel like was using it too much. Last thing want to do is to sound self-absorbed or like, onto something groundbreaking... Just messin around... These are my messin around objects lol... <br><br>

							But then... maybe I should have more confidence.
							These are my objects! I spent a lot of time thinking about them!

							Angsty backstory::: For a time, all I wanted to do was make "useful" things with technology,
							but I was pretty bad at that. It's like that quote, "If technology is the answer what was the question".
							It would be so wack if the question was begged like, "how can we fix ___ with technology?" Lol... but that
							was the question I was asking... and I think that was the question I was taught to ask in college...
							so, not totally my fault? My friend Kevin, whom I miss very much...we used to get together once in a while,
							buy our favorite beers and cook some food, and just rant and talk about relationships.
							Kevin described how, sometimes, when his other friend talked about a problem that was sort of a privileged problem,
							they would just tell the friend that it was a non-problem lol.
							Every time I look at technology as the answer, the question eventually becomes a non-problem, and that
							quickly drains the life and excitement out of it all. Every thing I made in the past featuring technology
							as the answer to some non-problem makes me cringeeeee. Maybe all this self-reflection about my anti-capitalist
							angst and my revenge story will also make me cringe one day too. Though, writing all this helped me figure out one thing...
							I don't want my website to have any of this weird problem-solution language or dynamics!

							These objects aren't solutions, they're just special effects.
							The effects arise from causes, which are explicit in the code, and that's exciting like physics.
							One day I want to make funnier effects with blurrier causes, like comics,
							or more generous effects with more communal causes, like gardens.
							"Make" is a strong word, though. Maybe I should want more to just witness it. And, only if
							the need and the opportunity arise, precipitate or maintain it. In this way, being a maker
							or janitor or appreciator should give me the same fulfillment.<br><br>

							One day I want to be free from cause and effect, like in dreams.<br><br>

							Fun trick if you're on a Mac. If you slowly four-finger-swipe up to the Mission Control screen, you can watch
							the tiny checker patterns on this page dissolve into different moir√© patterns!

							I have a habit of blazing through images. Even illustrations that an artist probably spent days coloring,
							or photographs of a glacier that took millenia to form, are consumed in a few seconds.
							My goal is to see fewer images, and spend more time with each. It's like that wardrobe philosophy of
							owning fewer nicer things.
